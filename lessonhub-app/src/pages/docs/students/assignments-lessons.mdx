# Assignments & Lessons

LessonHub keeps creation, assignment, and completion aligned. This page covers the full journey from a student's and teacher's perspective.

## Student Workflow

1. **Find Work:** Open a card from your dashboard (`/my-lessons`) to see the assignment details.
2. **Read:** The "Lesson Content View" shows you previews, instructions, audio, and attachments in one place.
3. **Complete:** Work through the lesson type—whether it's flashcards, multiple-choice questions, lyrics, or standard text responses.
4. **Submit:** Click the submit button in the footer. You'll see a confirmation status once your teacher reviews it.

## Sharing Lessons

You can easily share a lesson with others:
- **Tap the Share Icon:** Located on any lesson card.
- **Device Behavior:** On iPhone/iPad (Safari), this opens the native share sheet. On other devices, it copies a unique link to your clipboard.
