# ArkanING

ArkanING is a fast grammar game built around using or avoiding -ing forms.

## How it works

- Answer a question to launch the ball.
- You get a short countdown to move the paddle before the ball lifts.
- The ball always returns to the paddle and never falls.
- Correct answers start a round of play and award points + euros.
- Wrong answers deduct 50 points and 50 euros, and add a new brick row.

## Lives and mistakes

- You start with a set number of lives.
- Lives can be lost on every wrong answer or after a set number of wrong answers, depending on the lesson settings.

## Scoring

Each correct answer awards the points and euros set by your teacher. Wrong answers always deduct 50 points and 50 euros.
