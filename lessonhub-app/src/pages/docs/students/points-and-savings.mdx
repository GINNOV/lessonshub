# Points & Savings System

LessonHub uses a dual-currency system to track your progress: **Points** for the leaderboard and **Savings (Euros)** for your personal "bank."

## How Points Work

Points determine your rank on the leaderboard. They reward **quality** and **speed**.

### Earning Points
- **Graded Assignments:** You earn points for every assignment your teacher grades. Higher scores mean more points.
- **Extra Points:** Teachers can award bonus points for going above and beyond.
- **Gold Stars:** A special award that gives a massive point boost (calculated based on the star's value).

### Losing Points (Penalties)
- **Extensions:** Asking for a deadline extension costs **200 points**.
- **Composer Retries:** In Composer lessons, using extra tries to solve a puzzle costs **50 points per try**.
- **News Article low taps:** Submitting with **fewer than 6 taps** deducts points equal to **3× the lesson price**.

## How Savings (Euros) Work

Savings represent the "value" you have accumulated. While Points are about score, Savings are about the **monetary value** of the lessons you complete.

### Growing Your Savings
- **Completing Lessons:** When a lesson is graded, its **price** is added to your savings.
- **Gold Stars:** Every Gold Star has a direct Euro value (e.g., €5, €10) which is added immediately.
- **Extra Points:** Bonus points awarded by teachers are converted into small Euro amounts.

### Losing Savings
- **Failed Lessons:** If you fail an assignment, the lesson's price is **deducted** from your savings.
- **Composer Retries:** Each extra try costs **€50** in simulated value.
- **News Article low taps:** Submitting with **fewer than 6 taps** deducts **3× the lesson price**.

## The Gold Star 🌟

The Gold Star is the highest honor for a single assignment. It boosts both your metrics at once:
1.  **Euro Value:** It adds a specific amount (e.g., €10) to your Savings.
2.  **Points:** It adds a corresponding amount of points to your Leaderboard score.
