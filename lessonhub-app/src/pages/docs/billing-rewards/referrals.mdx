# Billing & Rewards: Referrals

Referrals let you invite friends and earn rewards when they subscribe.

## How it works

- Open the [referrals page](/referrals) to get your invite link and code.
- Share the link with friends who want to join LessonHub.
- When they subscribe, your rewards apply automatically.

## Tips

- Use the same link in messages so you can track outcomes in one place.
- If a friend did not get credit, ask them to confirm they used your link before subscribing.
- Track the students who joined through your invite link and see how your referrals are helping the community grow. $ [Your personal finance achievements are here.](/myfinance)
