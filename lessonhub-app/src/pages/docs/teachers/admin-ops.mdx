# Admin & Operations

Administrators have a bird's-eye view of the platform via the tile-based [admin dashboard](/dashboard).

## Core Management Areas

- **Users:** Invite new users, suspend accounts, or edit profiles. You can also "Pause" a user (same as the "Taking a Break" feature).
- **Lessons:** Oversee the entire lesson catalog, run database migrations, or seed default templates.
- **Emails:** Monitor the logs of all sent emails (transactional and marketing).
- **Settings:** Configure global settings, point values, and feature flags.
- **Cron:** Manually trigger system jobs (like "Start Date" notifications) or simulate time for testing.
- **Profile:** View your own profile with extra admin controls.

## System Jobs (Cron)

LessonHub runs automatic jobs to keep things moving:
- **Hourly:** Sends "Start Date" notifications (runs daily at 10:00 UTC on some plans).
- **Daily (09:00 UTC):** Sends assignment reminders and weekly summaries.

**Testing:** You can use the **Cron Test** page to simulate specific times and ensure emails are firing correctly.

## Database & Maintenance

- **Migrations:** Always run via the provided `npm` scripts to ensure safety.
- **Seeding:** If default templates or badges are missing, the seed script restores them without deleting existing data.

## Security & Best Practices

- **Secrets:** All sensitive keys (database passwords, API keys) are stored in `.env.local` and never shared.
- **Data:** Financial values (like prices) are handled with high precision.
- **Leaderboards:** Savings are displayed clearly with color-coding (Green for positive, Red for negative) to avoid confusion.

## Support Playbook

Common admin tasks:
- **Hub Guide Access:** If a student claims they paid but can't see guides, check their payment status in their Profile.
- **Lyric Errors:** If teachers report issues with lyric lessons, it often means a database migration is needed.
- **Timezones:** Encourage all users to set their timezone. Incorrect timezones are the #1 cause of "missed" deadlines.
