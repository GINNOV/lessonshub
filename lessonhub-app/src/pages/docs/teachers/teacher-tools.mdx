# Teacher Tools

Teachers manage their classes from the `/dashboard`. The tools are designed to be fast and direct.

## Assigning Lessons

1. Go to `/dashboard/assign/[lessonId]`.
2. **Select Students:** Use search and filters to find the right students. You can bulk-select.
3. **Set Dates:** Choose a Start Date and a Deadline.
4. **Notifications:** Decide when students should be notified.
5. **Submit:** Click to assign.

## Grading Submissions

1. Open the [grading page](/dashboard/grade/[assignmentId]).
2. **Review:** Check student answers.
3. **Feedback:** Add comments to specific questions or general feedback for the whole assignment.
4. **Score:** Assign a grade. This instantly updates the student's dashboard and points.

## Managing Lessons

- **Overview:** The lesson list shows you how many students have been assigned each lesson.
- **Difficulty:** Set difficulty levels using the visual bar meter.
- **Sharing:** Generate public share links for your lessons.

## Content Creation Tips

- **Instruction Booklets:** Don't rewrite the same instructions. Create a "Booklet" and insert it into any assignment with one click.
- **Audio:** Use the SoundCloud feed loader to quickly grab your latest tracks.
- **CSV Imports:** Most creators (Flashcards, Multi-choice) support CSV upload. Look for the icon button to bulk-import data.
- **Lyrics:** Upload an audio file and a `.lrc` file. LessonHub will sync them automatically for students.

## Managing Hub Guides

- **Drafts:** Set `guideIsVisible` to `false` while you are working on a guide.
- **Free Content:** Set `guideIsFreeForAll` to `true` to give it to everyone for free.
- **Updates:** Any changes you make are timestamped so students know there is new content.
