# News Article lessons

News Article lessons let teachers deliver a full article as markdown and give students a tap-to-pronounce reading experience.

## What students experience

- The article renders as a newspaper-style page.
- Tapping any word plays it three times: **normal**, **slow**, and **very slow**.
- A pronunciation helper (Italian-style spelling) appears in the meaning chip to guide students.
- The word meaning stays visible until the student dismisses it or taps another word.
- The first tap on a word awards **50 points** and **€0.50** in savings.
- Repeat taps on the same word award **5 points** and **€0.005** in savings.
- Penalties are based on **unique words tapped** (words longer than 4 letters).
- **>80%** of the article tapped: **2×** the lesson price (points and savings).
- **50–80%** tapped: **0.3%** of the lesson price (points and savings).
- **<50%** tapped: **0.5%** of the lesson price (points and savings).
- Students can submit manually, otherwise the lesson auto-submits after the deadline.

## Teacher options

- **Article (Markdown):** the main article body.
- **Max word taps (optional):** limit how many word taps are allowed. Leave blank for unlimited.
- **Lesson preview:** summary shown on the student card.
- **Price, difficulty, notes:** work like standard lessons.

## Pronunciation & speed details

- The lesson always plays the word three times with fixed rates (normal → slow → very slow).
- The slowest speed is intentionally extreme for careful listening.
- The helper shows Italian-style phonetic spelling (simplified, not IPA). It is designed for quick guidance, not perfect phonetics.

If you want different pronunciation rules or pacing, let us know and we can tune the mapping.
