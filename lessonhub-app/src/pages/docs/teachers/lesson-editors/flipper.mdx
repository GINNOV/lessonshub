# Flipper Lesson Editor

Use the Flipper lesson type to create a memory-style matching game where students pair an image tile with its word.

## Required

- **Lesson title** and **lesson preview**.
- **12 tiles**: upload 12 same-size images and add the matching word for each tile.
- **Attempts before penalty**: set how many failed attempts are allowed before penalties start (minimum 3).

## How it works for students

- Students flip two cards at a time to find matches.
- Attempts reset after each match.
- Rewards are based on attempts: attempt 1 = €10, attempt 2 = €5, attempt 3 = €1, then -€5 per extra attempt.
- Completed matches show a green check and lock.

## Tips

- Use clear, high-contrast images.
- Keep words short so they remain readable on mobile screens.
- Use similar image sizes to keep the grid clean.
