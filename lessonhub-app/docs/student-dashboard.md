# Student Dashboard

Your dashboard (`/my-lessons`) is your home base. It adapts to any screen size and keeps your most important tasks front and center.

## Stats Header

At the top, you see a quick summary of your progress:
- **Value Earned / Total Points:** Your lifetime impact on the platform.
- **Assignment Chips:** Quick filters for **Pending**, **Submitted**, **Graded**, **Failed**, and **Past Due**. These update in real-time.
- **Settings Link:** Check here for teacher notices or pacing guidelines.

## Tabs: Lessons & Hub Guides

- **Lessons Tab:** Your main view. Use the **search bar** to find lessons by title or teacher.
- **Hub Guides Tab:** Available if you have an active plan. Browse extra learning materials here.

## Assignment Cards

Each lesson appears as a card:
- **Cover Image:** Visual context for the lesson.
- **Status Badge:** Instantly see if work is Pending, Graded, or Overdue.
- **Difficulty Meter:** Filled bars show how challenging the lesson is.
- **Footer Actions:**
    - **Teacher Avatar:** Click to visit the teacher's profile.
    - **Share:** Copy the lesson link or share via your device.
    - **Practice:** Launch flashcards or quizzes.
    - **Deadline:** Shown in 24-hour format. Turns **red** when overdue.

## Gamification: Points & Rewards

LessonHub rewards consistent effort. Here is how the points system works:

### Earning Points
- **Graded Assignments:** You earn points based on your score.
- **Gold Stars:** Teachers can award a **Gold Star** for exceptional work. This gives you a significant boost in both **Points** and **Euro Savings**.

### Penalties (Watch Out!)
Sometimes points are deducted to simulate real-world costs:
- **Extensions:** Need more time? Asking for a deadline extension costs **200 points**.
- **Composer Lessons:** In these special lessons, you have a set number of tries. Every extra try costs **50 points**.

### Practical Examples
> **Scenario A: The Perfect Run**
> You complete an assignment perfectly and get **+100 points**. Your savings grow!
>
> **Scenario B: The Extension**
> You do great work (+100 points) but you asked for an extension (-200 points).
> Result: **-100 points**. It is better to submit on time!
>
> **Scenario C: Composer Tries**
> You are stuck on a hard question and use 3 extra tries.
> 3 extra tries x 50 points = **-150 points**.
> Even if you get the answer right, those attempts cost you.
