## Navigation basics

- **Top navigation:** avatar menu for profile, sign-out, and account state.
- **Tabs:** pill-style controls such as “Lessons / Hub Guides.” Tap or click; the active tab darkens and raises slightly.
- **Cards:** every assignment, guide, or stat uses a consistent card grid. Hover on desktop or tap on mobile for actions.

## Essential first step

After your first sign-in, open **Profile → Update Profile**. Set your timezone, upload a photo, and confirm your preferred name. These details power deadlines, leaderboard entries, and notifications throughout the system.
