# Student Dashboard

Everything important lives on `/my-lessons`. The layout adapts to your screen while keeping information easy to scan.

## Stats header

- **Value earned / total points:** shows lifetime impact.
- **Assignment chips:** Pending, Submitted, Graded, Failed, Past Due. Each badge is color-coded and updates in real time.
- **Settings link:** opens any teacher-defined notices or pacing guidelines.

## Tabs: Lessons & Hub Guides

- **Lessons tab:** default view. Use the search bar with the magnifier icon to filter by lesson title or teacher. Status filters (ALL, PENDING, GRADED, FAILED) sit beside the search input.
- **Hub Guides tab:** available when your plan is active. Free users see a banner encouraging them to unlock access.

## Assignment cards

- **Cover image:** curated artwork per lesson type.
- **Status badge:** Pending, Submitted, Graded, Failed, or Past Due.
- **Difficulty meter:** same filled bars used throughout the app.
- **Footer actions:**
  - Teacher avatar leading to `/teachers#id`.
  - Submission stats (submitted vs. total).
  - Share button with native share support on iOS and clipboard fallback everywhere else.
  - Practice button for graded flashcard or multi-choice lessons.
  - Deadline rendered in 24-hour format, tinted red when overdue.

## Gamification

- **Achievements card:** collapsed by default; expand to review badges and lifetime points.
- **Next Up card:** mirrors the same toggle UI. View upcoming rewards and recent points activity.

## Leaderboard

- Desktop shows a full table with rank, speed tier, and savings.
- Mobile condenses each entry into a card.
- Savings are green when positive, red when negative, and gray at zero—making trends obvious at a glance.

## Hub Guide banner

- Premium students can dismiss the gradient banner after reading it.
- Free members see the same component with an “Unlock Hub Guides” button that links to Profile → Billing.
