# Assignments & Lessons

LessonHub keeps creation, assignment, and completion aligned. This page covers the full journey.

## Student workflow

1. **Open a card** from `/my-lessons` to reach `/assignments/[assignmentId]`.
2. **Read the context:** previews, instructions, attachments, and audio are rendered consistently via Lesson Content View.
3. **Complete the work:** flashcards, multi-choice, lyric lessons, or standard responses.
4. **Submit:** the footer confirms submission and shows grading status once your teacher reviews it.

## Sharing lessons

- Tap the share icon on any student card.
- On iOS Safari, the native share sheet appears. On other browsers, LessonHub copies the link to your clipboard and shows a toast.
- Each lesson has a persistent share ID; teachers can regenerate it from the assignment form if needed.

## Teacher creation tools

All lesson builders live under the teacher dashboard and share the same patterns:

### Lesson Form

- Title, preview, price, and difficulty.
- Assignment image upload powered by the new icon-based file picker or Image Browser.
- Optional audio and notes fields.
- Instruction booklets can replace or append reusable content in seconds.

### Multi-Choice Creator

- Add questions inline or import from CSV.
- Upload assignment artwork with the same Upload button.
- Attach reading material or SoundCloud/Youtube audio.
- Manage answer options, correctness, and per-question notes.

### Flashcard Creator

- Import from CSV or add cards manually.
- Upload artwork for the lesson and individual card sides.
- Preview automatically sorts cards when students practice.

### Guide Creator (Hub Guides)

- Create multi-step learning cards with content1–content4 + extra notes.
- Import entire sessions from CSV using the Upload button.
- Select guide cover art from curated options or upload your own.

## Grading & feedback

- Teachers grade from `/dashboard/grade/[assignmentId]`.
- Students see scores, per-question comments, and overall notes in `/assignments/[assignmentId]`.
- Points feed directly into Gamification and Leaderboard modules.
