# Profile, Billing & Timezones

Your profile anchors notifications, deadlines, and Hub Guide access. Keep it updated to ensure LessonHub feels effortless.

## Profile tabs

- **Profile:** name, photo, gender, timezone, weekly summary opt-in, and student bio.
- **About me:** available to teachers for their directory bio. Markdown supported.
- **Status:** for students to pause lessons (“Taking a Break”). Teachers and admins can toggle it on behalf of a student.
- **Password:** change credentials directly unless your account is admin-managed.
- **Delete Account:** visible to non-admin users; requires a typed confirmation sentence.

All tabs use the new pill-style selector. Tap or click a tab to bring it forward—active tabs feature an indigo ring and shadow.

## Photo uploads

- Use the Upload button beside your avatar.
- The icon-based control accepts standard image formats and displays the chosen filename.
- After uploading, click **Save Profile Changes** to persist it.

## Timezone & notifications

- Lesson deadlines show in 24-hour format and respect the timezone you set here.
- Weekly summary emails arrive on Sunday unless you opt out via the toggle.

## Billing & Hub Guides

- The **Billing & Hub Guides** panel lives within the Status tab.
- Students can redeem coupons, confirm prepaid access, or upgrade via their teacher.
- Hub Guides unlock automatically once payment is active. The banner on `/my-lessons` updates accordingly.

## Taking a break

- Slide the “Lessons Paused” switch to pause all assignments.
- Students see a bilingual notice explaining how to resume.
- Teachers and admins can adjust this state from their management consoles.
